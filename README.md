Welcome to the front end of Watering Can!

To get started you will need:
* npm 6.7.0
* the back end of Watering Can with a running server

Once you have those, clone the app to your computer!

Navigate to the directory in terminal
Use
```
npm install
npm run serve
```

Go to http://localhost:8080 and follow the prompts to get your calendar!

Make sure your plants file is .json in a format similar to the one below:

```
[
  {
    "name": "plant 1",
    "water_after": "6 days"
  },
  {
    "name": "plant 2",
    "water_after": "14 days"
  }
]
```
